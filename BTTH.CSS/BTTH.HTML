    <p class="demo-class">
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.
    </p>
    <div class="demo-class">
        With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are
        positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for
        different devices and screen sizes, and much more!
    </div>
    <div class="spec-demo">
        <b>Tip:</b> The word <b>cascading</b> means taht a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all
        children elements
        within the parent. So, if you set the color of the budy text to "blue", all headings, paragraphs, and other text
        elements within the body will also get the same color (unless you specify something else)!
