            plugin adds the <br>
            approprite
            classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall <br> appearance, as well as te
            showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with <br> custom CSS or overriding our
            default
            variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML <br> can go within the <i> .accordion-body</i>,
            thought
            the
            trasition does limit overflow.</p>
